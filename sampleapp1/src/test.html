          until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each
          element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and
          hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding
          our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within
          the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
