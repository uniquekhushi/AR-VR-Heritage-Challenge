                The Taj Mahal, an ivory-white marble Tombstone on the south bank of the Yamuna river in the Indian city of Agra, was commissioned in 1632 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan to house the tomb of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. The Taj Mahal is an iconic symbol of India and a masterpiece of Mughal architecture, known for its stunning beauty, intricate details, and its story of eternal love. This UNESCO World Heritage Site attracts millions of visitors from around the world each year.

                The construction of the Taj Mahal was completed in 1653 and involved thousands of artisans and craftsmen. The tomb is part of a larger complex that includes a mosque, a guest house, and extensive formal gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall. The Taj Mahal is universally admired for its architectural beauty, harmonious proportions, and its impressive use of white marble adorned with semi-precious stones.

              <Paragraph>
                The history of the Taj Mahal is as fascinating as the structure itself. Shah Jahan, the Mughal emperor, was devastated by the death of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal during childbirth. In her memory, he decided to build the most beautiful mausoleum the world had ever seen. The construction began in 1632 and took 21 years to complete. The emperor's grief and his vision of love and beauty were captured in the architecture of the Taj Mahal, making it an everlasting symbol of love.

              <Paragraph>
                The architecture of the Taj Mahal combines elements from Islamic, Persian, Ottoman Turkish, and Indian architectural styles. The most striking feature is the white marble dome that surmounts the tomb. The dome is nearly 35 meters (115 ft) high and is surrounded by four smaller domed kiosks (chattris). The marble is inlaid with precious and semi-precious stones in intricate patterns, including floral designs and calligraphy.

              <Paragraph>
                The Taj Mahal also features four minarets, one at each corner of the plinth, which are designed slightly outward to protect the main tomb in case of a collapse. The gardens of the Taj Mahal follow the charbagh design, which is a Persian-inspired quadrilateral layout.
